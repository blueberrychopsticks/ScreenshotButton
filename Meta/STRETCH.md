# Stretch Goals and Brainstorm Ideas

What if there could be a multi linked way of handling TODOS?
todos file in the repo
todos entry in a code file
todos entry in JIRA
todos entry in GitHub pages
todos entry in Notion, YATA (yet another todo app)
Everything syncs when a todo is added, completed, or otherwise modified
