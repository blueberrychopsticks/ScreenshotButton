change this to TCA and consume state rather than state providers

git commit hash -- automatically link github based on git commit

show error

follow focus / show on all desktops

copy (export) all text to markdown'ed links or json or variable names (or maybe even a resume
         ---- generator? talk to chris - that's one smart cookie)

Create directory if it doesn't exist

Automatically prepend file name for easy organization and context in applications
  such as Notion where filenames are kept.

Take care of appending / to filepath if it isn't there

Better layout

TCA practice?
