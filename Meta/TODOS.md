screenshot triggered from phone

keyboard shortcut and toolbar item mandatory for helpful use

change this to TCA and consume state rather than state providers

have button follow close to a clickable area of the mouse drag after drag ends and debounces for a few milliseconds - not too slow to slow down user - not too fast to make it glitch. <sweet spot>

git commit -- automatically link github based on git commit

show error

follow focus / show on all desktops

copy (export) all text to markdown'ed links or json or variable names (or maybe even a resume
         ---- generator? talk to chris - that's one smart cookie)

Create directory if it doesn't exist

Automatically prepend file name for easy organization and context in applications
  such as Notion where filenames are kept.

Take care of appending / to filepath if it isn't there

Better layout

Single keyboard hotkey from anywhere (even if app is backgrounded)

TCA practice?
